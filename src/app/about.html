        When medical care cannot offer a cure; hospice provides comfort and support for individuals with life-limiting
        conditions. Hospice care allows for a patient-centered team approach that includes a physician, a nurse, a
        social worker, chaplain, volunteers and home health aides. This team works together to ensure all patient needs
        are met including physical needs, social, psychological and spiritual.
        We are committed to bringing comfort, dignity and quality of life to our patients. Hospice is not about giving
        up, but taking control in the end-stages of life.

        Contigo Hospice is locally owned and not part of a corporation or franchise. We are a part of the Rio Grande
        Valley community and have a desire to serve that community as we would our own families.
        We believe caring for people with life limiting illness requires a different set of skills than other kinds of
        healthcare with emphasis on physical comfort and emotional support. Our Hospice team are experts in end-of-life
        care, serving as an extension of your family to create a personalized plan ensuring the best possible care is
        received.
        We believe it is our responsibility to provide dignity, compassion and peace of mind for patients and families.
